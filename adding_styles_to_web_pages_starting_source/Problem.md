### Expected Outcome

Follow the template shown below for designing the web page

![Practice 3 Template](images/page-template.png)

### Design Requirements

- The page should be designed based on Web 2.0 standards using semantic HTML5 elements and CSS style properties
- Page should have a meaningful title
- This practice is an extension to Practice 2
- Based upon the template shared, each element on the page has to be styled using CSS style properties
- Header and Footer although different elements, but should be styled using same style rules
- The template shows that both header and footer are styled using the same background image
- Use CSS properties to size, align and apply rounded border to the image in the main section
- The navigation link text color should change when the link is hovered and when clicked.
- The paragraphs in the main section should be justified on both sides
- Highlight the aside element with a different color to make it distinctly displayed

### Design Guidelines

- Across all sections of page, harmony in terms of color, font, spacing and alignment should be maintained
- Page should not allow horizontal scrolling
- Images provided in boilerplate should only be used
- Adhere to the files and folder structure provided with the boilerplate

### Code Quality Guidelines
- Usage of HTML5 semantic elements is intended in designing the structure
- Usage of CSS3 style properties is intended for styling page design
- Inline and Embedded styles should not be used
- No 3rd Party frameworks should be used for designing purpose
- Code should be well structured with proper spacing and indentation
- Meaninful names should be given to element ids and css classes
- Naming conventions should be followed
- Use Web 2.0 fonts only
- No deprecated code should be used

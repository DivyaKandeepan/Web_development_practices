          The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the <b>standard markup language</b> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
          HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.

          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a <b>style sheet language</b> used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
          markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone 
          technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of content 
          and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more 
          flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting
          by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
          and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its 
          formatting.
